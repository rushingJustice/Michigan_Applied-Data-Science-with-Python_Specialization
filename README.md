# UofM-Data-Science---Machine-Learning-Data-Anslysis-and-Visualization
A 5-week specilization course that I completed - demonstrating proficiency in data analysis, visualization and appliaction of machine learning models/tools.

Topics covered: data visualization, data processing/cleaning, and machine learning (regression and classificaion methods using SVMs, logistic regression, decision trees and neural networks).

The blight.ipynb is a notebook documenting Assignment 4 of the Machine Learning section. It is also a Kaggle Competition and is found in my Kaggle results repository below:
